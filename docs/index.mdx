description: Codex is building a decentralised durability storage engine
---


## Codex

> The Codex project aims to create a decentralized durability engine that allows persisting data in p2p networks. In other words, it allows storing files and data with predictable durability guarantees for later retrieval.

> WARNING: This project is under active development and is considered pre-alpha.


## Testnet flow and ideas for Codex
What can you try on our network

1. **Make storage available** to the Codex network (for storage providers)
2. Ask the network to **store files** on the Codex
3. **Run multiple nodes** and try to put on their storage hosts hats
4. **Spin your own node** and go over the entire installation process
5. Look at the **speed and performance of the entire user flow** and provide feedback to the team
6. Try to store large files (2gb or more) and report any potential issue that had
7. Test how **upload** to the networks works for **small and large files**
8. **Check the Retrieval flow** for files that are stored on the network + speed to get it back
9. **General usability test**: provide feedback on the system performance and which steps you found difficult.


## How to get started with Codex and test all of the scenarios we mentioned above
> It’s really simple - you just need to follow all the steps for our cool [codex-testnet-starter](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter)

### Steps to kick-off and use codex are:

**Prerequisites:**
1. Docker-desktop
2. Discord + Join our server
3. Enough tech knowledge to set up a port forwarding in your local network

**Steps to join the Codex network:**
1. Clone repository
2. Modify docker-compose file with:
  a. Your own private key
  b. Bootstrap-SPR with one from the list

3. Mint some test-tokens:
  a. In the discord server, give your public key / eth address to the bot
  b. Mint some tokens using the bot
4. You may have to forward the following ports from the docker-compose file:
    1. Codex Discovery - UDP (8090 by default)
    2. Codex Listen - TCP (8070 by default)
    3. Geth Discovery - UDP (8547 by default)
    4. Geth Listen - TCP (8548 by default)
5. Start the docker-compose file
6. Wait until the Geth node is synced
7. Open the Codex-Frontend in your browser
8. Rejoice!


Also keep in mind - we have a new, stunning feature that will help us with user flow and reward them - we call it “**Discord roles for rewards**”

**How does it work:**

We can create and config any number of Discord server roles as rewards for testnet participation. The bot can automatically give discord roles to users as they reach certain milestones in the testnet.

Here are some examples to consider:

- Hosting:
    - Fill a slot of any size and duration
    - Finish a slot of any size and duration
    - Finish a slot of minimum 256MB and 24h
- Interacting with the Codex Client:
    - Post a contract
    - Post a contract that reaches “Started” state
    - Post a contract with at least 4 slots, where each slot is at least 256MB, and has a duration of at least 24h, and it reaches “Started” state
